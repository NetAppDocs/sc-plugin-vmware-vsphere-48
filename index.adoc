summary: SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV) is a Linux-based Virtual Appliance. As a standalone, it provides fast, space-efficient, crash-consistent, and VM-consistent backup and restore operations for VMs, Datastores, and VMDKs. It also works with SnapCenter Server to support application-based backup and restore operations in VMware environments for SnapCenter application-specific plug-ins.
